# Pseudospectral Initial Data Solver

This repository contains Python implementations of the **pseudospectral method** for solving boundary value problems in numerical relativity and related areas.  
The method uses **Chebyshev polynomials** on Gaussâ€“Lobatto collocation points to expand smooth functions and enforce differential equations at discrete grid points.  

Currently, the repository includes:

- `ps_back.py` â€” Solver for generating **initial data for a massive complex scalar field** using a pseudospectral Newton iteration scheme.  
- `ps_poisson.py` â€” A simpler **Poisson equation solver** implemented with the same pseudospectral framework, useful for testing and benchmarking.  
- `test.pdf` â€” A test pdf file containing sufficient theory regarding the approaches used
